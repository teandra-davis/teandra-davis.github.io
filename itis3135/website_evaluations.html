                        <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast</li> : This website effectively uses contrast by keeping a minimal color palette. It utilizes black and white with splashes of
                        color added based on the theme. The splashes of color stand out and is used relevantly. 
                        <li><strong>R</strong>eptition</li> : The over theme of the website is kept consistent as the fonts, font-sizing, colors, and element themes stays the same
                        throughout the website. 
                        <li><strong>A</strong>lignment</li> : This website uses a variety of alignments to draw the eye, using left and right justification. 
                        <li><strong>P</strong>roximity</li> : The website uses proximity expertely adding related elements close to each other. The elements of the page are evenly 
                        distributed throughout the webpage expressing the idea of effective white space.

                    <p>Description of Website</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast</li> : This website fails to use the principle of contrast. It does use contrasting colors 
                        with the white background and choosing the font color as a deep blue and accented color of gray. Although the website fails
                        to use color variation to appeal to the audience. The size contrast is simple and boring. Lastly, it doesn't hold any shape
                        contrast.
                        <li><strong>R</strong>epetition</li> : This website contains good repetition and it uses consistent colors, fonts and sizing.
                        The website uses it's alignment and columns consistently as well.
                        <li><strong>A</strong>lignment</li> : This website uses alignment properly by creating order and each element visually connets to the other element.
                        <li><strong>P</strong>roximity</li> : The website uses proximity by effectively associating related elements close to each other. It looks organized 
                        and it's not hard for the user to navigate the page and find related content.
